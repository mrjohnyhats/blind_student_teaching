// # begin exercise 1
// write an if statement that can run code if i is greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 50 at the marker. The if statement doesn't actually have to run code:
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 20;
        // # write your code below this line:

    }
}
// # end exercise 1
// # begin exercise 2
// write an if statement that can run code if the string "dog" equals 5 and other code if it doesn't at the marker. Again, it doesn't actually have to run code:
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // # write your code below this line:
    }
}
// # end exercise 2
