// VARIABLES:

int i;
// the bit of code above tells the computer to make space for an integer (int) called i. It doesn't know what the integer is, but it knows that it exists.
// this is called variable instantiation or declaration and is the first step into making a variable in your program
i = 5;
// this bit of code defines our variable to store the number 5. Now when we mention i in our code, it'll be substituted for the number 5
int j = 10;
// this bit of code combines the 2 previous things we did. It declares a variable that will hold an integer called j. Then it defines the variable as 10.

// below are some examples of other types of variables, and how they are defined
String s = "Hello, I am a string";
char c = 'a';
boolean b = true;

// one of the cool things about java and other programming languages is that they let you make your own types of variables called classes, but you'll get to that later
// for now we will focus on using these types of variables. These can be called 'primitive' types since they're very basic

// # end example
